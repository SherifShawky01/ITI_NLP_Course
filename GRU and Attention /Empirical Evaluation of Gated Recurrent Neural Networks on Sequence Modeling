### Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling (Chung et al., 2014)**

- Compares the effectiveness of **LSTM**, **GRU**, and traditional **tanh** units in RNNs across different sequence tasks.
- Evaluates on datasets such as **polyphonic music** and **speech signals**, measuring the models' ability to learn long-term dependencies.
- Finds that both **GRU and LSTM** units outperform tanh-based RNNs in terms of convergence and generalization.
- GRU shows similar performance to LSTM but with fewer parameters, making it **faster and more efficient**.
- Highlights that the gating mechanisms in LSTM and GRU help mitigate the **vanishing gradient problem** and preserve important information across time steps.
